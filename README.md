#  Student Mental Health Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of students (ages 18â€“21) to uncover trends and patterns related to **mental health, stress, and well-being**.

This dataset captures survey responses from 843 college students aged 18â€“21 regarding their experiences with stress, health, relationships, academics, and emotional well-being. The responses were collected via Google Forms using a five-point Likert scale ("Not at all" to "Extremely") 0 to 5 and anonymized to protect privacy.

I used **SQL** for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, then visualized the findings using **Tableau** to create clear and insightful charts. The aim is to understand the factors affecting studentsâ€™ mental health and highlight meaningful correlations.

##  Key Insights
The analysis highlights several important relationships between student lifestyle factors and mental health:
- **Anxiety , stress & other factors** â†’ Studnets with high anxiety and stress reported negative effect on other factors.
- **Sleep & attendance** â†’ Students with irregular sleep patterns reported higher stress and lower overall mental health.  
- **Workload vs. Leisure** â†’ Higher workloads correlated with increased anxiety, while balanced leisure time improved well-being.  
- **Gender Comparison** â†’ Female students reported slightly higher stress and anxiety levels compared to male students.  
- **Peer Relationships** â†’ Stronger peer connections were associated with better overall mental health outcomes.  

 Visualizations of these findings are included in the `/charts` folder.
